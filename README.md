Welcome to **nftix**, an innovative platform aiming to revolutionize event ticketing through the power of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain technology.

## Overview

Traditional ticketing systems often face challenges such as fraud, scalping, and lack of transparency. NFTix seeks to address these issues by leveraging NFTs to create secure, verifiable, and unique digital tickets stored on a blockchain. This approach ensures authenticity, traceability, and offers enhanced features for both event organizers and attendees.

## Why NFTs as Tickets?

- Each ticket is minted as a unique NFT.
- All transactions related to an NFT are publicly visible on the ledger, ensuring that the ticket is original and has not been resold
- An NFT ticket cannot be counterfeited.
- A simple smart contract can be used to check the validity of a ticket, enabling a simple and automated event entry experience.

## Getting Started
